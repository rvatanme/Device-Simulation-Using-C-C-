# Device Simulation Using C/C++ & Python Programming
Writting C/C++ and Python code in order to simulate the IV curve of a PN diode based on drift diffusion model.

## Drift Diffusion Model: Derivation
All aspects of any electronic semiconductor device relies on the dynamics of carriers in semicondutors. Many models depending on the type and scale of a device have been presented to describe carrier transport. One of the simplest and most widely used models is so called Drift-Diffusion (DD) model. According to the DD model, in a one-dimensional system, the current is given by:
